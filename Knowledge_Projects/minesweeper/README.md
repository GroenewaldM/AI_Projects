# Minesweeper


## Summary

This program allows you to play Minesweeper or allows you to prompt the AI to play for you and make a safe move.


## Getting Started

* Download the distribution code from https://github.com/GroenewaldM/AI_Projects/tree/main/Knowledge_Projects/minesweeper.
* Once in the directory for the project, run pip3 install -r requirements.txt to install the required Python package (pygame) for this project if you donâ€™t already have it installed.
* Run runner.py


## Understanding

There are two main files in this project: runner.py and minesweeper.py. minesweeper.py contains all of the logic the game itself and for the AI to play the game. runner.py contains all of the code to run the graphical interface for the game. You can run runner.py to play Minesweeper (or let your AI play for you)!
