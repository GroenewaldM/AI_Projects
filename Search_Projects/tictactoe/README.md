# Tic-Tac-Toe


## Summary

This program allows you to play tic-tac-toe against an AI that uses a Minimax algorythm to play optimally.


## Getting Started

* Download the distribution code from https://github.com/GroenewaldM/AI_Projects/tree/main/Search_Projects/tictactoe.
* Once in the directory for the project, run pip3 install -r requirements.txt to install the required Python package (pygame) for this project.
* Run runner.py


## Understanding

There are two main files in this project: runner.py and tictactoe.py. tictactoe.py contains all of the logic for playing the game, and for the AI to make optimal moves. runner.py contains all of the code to run the graphical interface for the game. Once you run runner.py you will be able to tic-tac-toe against the AI!
